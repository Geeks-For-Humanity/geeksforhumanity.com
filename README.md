I heard Geeks For Humanity from a speaker at the 2025 1EdTech Impact Conference. I believe it was Michael Feldstein who said it. That we are geeks for education, geeks for technology, and geeks for ... which make us geeks for humanity. We were there to come together for the good of the children being educated.
    
Geeks for Humanity resonated with me. I saw this domain open and decided to purchase it. I'm not sure yet what I want to do with it. I am using it to explore DiD's right now.
